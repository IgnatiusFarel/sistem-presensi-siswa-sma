# Vue 3 + Vite 🚀

This template helps you get started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. It uses Vue 3's `<script setup>` syntax for Single File Components (SFCs). For a detailed explanation of the syntax, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup). 📄

## Project Structure 🗂️

Here’s an overview of the main folders and files you'll find in a **Vue 3 + Vite** project.

### 1. **`src/`** 🔧
   - **Purpose**: The `src/` folder is where all of your application’s source code lives.
   - **Example Files/Folders**:
     - **`assets/`**: Contains static assets like images, styles, etc.
     - **`components/`**: Holds your Vue components (e.g., `.vue` files).
     - **`App.vue`**: The root component for your application.
     - **`main.js`**: The entry point for your Vue application, where Vue is initialized and mounted.

### 2. **`public/`** 🌐
   - **Purpose**: The `public/` folder contains static files that are served directly by the server, such as `index.html`.
   - **Example Files**:
     - **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that includes your Vue application. Vite injects your JavaScript and CSS into this file during the build process.

### 3. **`vite.config.js`** ⚙️
   - **Purpose**: The `vite.config.js` file contains configuration settings for Vite, such as customizing build options, plugin configuration, or server settings.
   - **Example**:
     - `base: '/'` – Defines the base public path for assets.
     - `plugins: [...]` – Where you can add Vite plugins.

### 4. **`node_modules/`** 📦
   - **Purpose**: This folder contains all your dependencies installed via npm (or yarn). You generally won't need to modify files here directly.
   - **Note**: Always use `npm install` or `yarn add` to manage dependencies.

### 5. **`package.json`** 📜
   - **Purpose**: The `package.json` file manages project metadata, scripts, and dependencies.
   - **Example Scripts**:
     - **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development server.
     - **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production.
     - **`npm run serve`**: Serves the production build locally.

### 6. **`README.md`** 📚
   - **Purpose**: This file provides an overview of your project. You can update it to explain the purpose of your app, how to contribute, or document important information about the project.

## Development Setup 🛠️

### 1. **Install dependencies**
   Make sure you have **Node.js** installed, then run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
````

### 2. **Run the development server**

Start the development server with the command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default. 🚀

### 3. **Build for production**

When you’re ready to build your application for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be output to the `dist/` directory. 📦

### 4. **Preview production build**

After building your project, you can preview the production build with:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This will start a local server to preview your production build. 🌍
